# Documentation (WIP)

Upcoming content:

- **Getting Started:** installing the package, wiring the pytest plugin, and configuring database targets.
- **CLI Cookbook:** examples for `pytest-chronicle run|ingest|latest-red|backfill|export-sqlite|import-sqlite|db`.
- **Migration Guide:** mapping from legacy `tools/test_results` scripts to the new console entry points.
- **Schema Reference:** Alembic migration history and data model notes for `test_runs` / `test_cases`.

These notes will be promoted into a full guide as we stabilize the interface.
